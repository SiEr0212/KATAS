Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:

if x>y - 3 points
if x<y - 0 point
if x=y - 1 point
Notes:

there are 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= '4
*/

const points = (games) => {
    let totalPoints = 0;
    let result;
    for (let i = 0; i < games.length; i++) {
      result = games[i];
      if (result[0] > result[2]) {
        totalPoints += 3;
      } else if (result[0] === result[2]) {
        totalPoints += 1;
      }
    }
    return totalPoints;
  };
