/*
 Return String of First Characters

 from codewars: https://www.codewars.com/kata/5639bdcef2f9b06ce800005b/train/javascript

 In this exercise, a string is passed to a method and a new string has to be returned with the first character of each word in the string.

For example:

"This Is A Test" ==> "TIAT"

Strings will only contain letters and spaces, with exactly 1 space between words, and no leading/trailing spaces.

 //My solution:

 const makeString = s => s.split(" ").map(c => c[0]).join('');

 makeString("brown eyes are nice");//returns:"bean"
