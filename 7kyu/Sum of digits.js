/*  
Sum of digits

It involves implementing a program that sums the digits of a non-negative integer. 
For example, the sum of 3433 digits is 13.

Digits can be a number, a string, or undefined. In case of undefined return an empty string ''.

To give you a little more excitement, the program will not only write the result of the sum, 
but also write all the sums used: 3 + 4 + 3 + 3 = 13.
